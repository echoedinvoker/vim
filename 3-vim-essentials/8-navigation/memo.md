- How to memory four keys:

	- h - left one, so use it to move left.

	- l - right one, so use it to move right.

	- j - Looks like a fish hook, the fish hook to put down to the bottom of the sea fishing, so use it down.

	- k - only left one direction up.

- Press and hold the button is very practical, do not need to use a special way to look skillful.
